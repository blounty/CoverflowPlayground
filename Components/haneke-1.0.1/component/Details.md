# HanekeComponent details

![Haneke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haneke/Haneke/master/Assets/github-header.png)

A lightweight zero-config image cache for Xamarin iOS.

Haneke resizes images and caches the result on memory and disk. Everything is done in background, allowing for fast, responsive scrolling. Asking Haneke to load, resize, cache and display an *appropriately sized image* is as simple as:

	ImageView.SetImage(url);

_Really._
